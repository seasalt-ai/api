{"openapi":"3.0.2","info":{"title":"SeaX Bulk SMS","description":"- [Overview](#section/Overview)\n- [Quick Start](#section/Quick-Start)\n- [Authorization](#section/Authorization)\n- [Features](#section/Features)\n\n## Overview\nSeaX Bulk SMS helps you manage communication with customers through SMS/MMS.\n\n### Send\n1. Send Bulk SMS/MMS\n2. Schedule send up to 7 days in advance\n2. Respect \"Do Not Contact\"\n3. View the Delivery Report\n4. Send from multiple numbers\n\n### Receive\n1. Capture auto opt-in and opt-out\n2. Receive customer replies and text back\n\n### Contact Management\n1. Import/export contact list\n2. Assign multiple labels to contact\n3. Group contacts by the label to Bulk Send\n\n## Quick Start\n### Sending a campaign\n#### 1. Follow the steps in [Authorization](#section/Authorization) to generate APIKey to authorize your request\n\n#### 2. Import contacts\n1. [Import contacts](#tag/contact/operation/import_contacts_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__import_contacts_post).\n2. [Get job status](#tag/jobs/operation/get_job_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__jobs__job_id__get) by job_id from previous step. If the status of the `job` is `finished` or `failed`, it means the progress of importing contacts is over.\n\n#### 3. Launch campaign\n1. [Send a campaign](#tag/campaigns/operation/create_campaign_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__campaigns_post).\n2. [Get job status](#tag/jobs/operation/get_job_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__jobs__job_id__get) by job_id from previous step.\nIf the status of the `job` is `finished` or `failed`, it means the progress of the campaign is over.\n3. [Check the result of campaign](#tag/campaigns/operation/list_campaign_logs_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__campaigns__campaign_id__logs_get).\n\n### Sending an SMS/MMS\n#### 1. [Get the id of the sender phone.](#tag/phones/operation/get_phones_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__phones_get)\n#### 2. [Send an SMS/MMS from the sender's phone with its id to the contact phone.](#tag/messages/operation/send_message_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__send_message_post)\n\n### Contact Management\n#### 1. Create contacts with RESTful APIs\n1. [Create contact labels.](#tag/contact_label/operation/create_contact_label_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__contact_labels_post)\n2. [Create contacts with contact labels.](#tag/contact/operation/create_contact_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__contacts_post)\n\n#### 2. Create contacts by importing CSV\n1. [Import contacts](#tag/contact/operation/import_contacts_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__import_contacts_post).\n2. [Get job status](#tag/jobs/operation/get_job_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__jobs__job_id__get) by job_id from previous step. If the status of the `job` is `finished` or `failed`, it means the progress of importing contacts is over.\n\n\n## Authorization\n### Access token and refresh token\nThe `access token` is for authorization and the `refresh token` is to get a new `access token` when the old one is expired. The detailed description is here https://seaauth.seasalt.ai/redoc.\n1. [Login into SeaAuth](https://seaauth.seasalt.ai/redoc#tag/users/operation/login_api_v1_users_login_post) with scope `seax-bulk-sms`. The scope value would authorize the access token to use the endpoint of SeaX Bulk SMS.\n2. Add `access token` to the header `Authorization` with the `Bearer` prefix, for example, `Authorization`:`Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1...`.\n\n### API Key\nBecause the `access token` has a limit lifetime, it is inconvenient for backend integration to refresh after expiration. There is an `API Key` that would not expire until you refresh it. Here is how you can get a\n`API Key`.\n1. [Create API Key](#tag/api_keys/operation/reset_api_key_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__api_keys_reset_post).\n2. Add APIKey to the header `X-API-Key`.\n\n<!-- ## Features\n### Auto reply with Keyword\n#### What is the keyword?\nWhen an inbound message from the contact is sent to your phone, the keyword would try to match the message and do the following two things:\n1. Automatically respond to the contact of an inbound message with a defined reply message.\n2. Add the defined labels to the contact of the inbound message.\n\n#### How do keywords work?\nThe matching process works as below:\n1. Match the message with system DNC words `stop`, `unsubscribe`, `remove me`, `stop sending me messages`, `wrong person`, and `wrong number`. If it matched, Add the system\nlabel `DNC` to the contact and reply to the contact with `dnc_reply_message` if the `enabled_dnc_reply` of your phone is `True`.\n2. If no match in Step 1. Match the message with the keywords associated with your phone in order of priority. When it matches, there is fine-grained control of automatic reply and adding a label with `enabled_auto_reply` and `enabled_contact_label`.\n3. If no match in Step 2. Reply to the contact with `generic_reply_message` if the `enabled_generic_reply` of your phone is `True`. -->","version":"Beta"},"paths":{"/bulk-sms-api/api/v1/workspace/{workspace_id}/campaigns":{"get":{"tags":["campaigns"],"summary":"List Campaigns","description":"List all campaigns","operationId":"list_campaigns_api_v1_workspace__workspace_id__campaigns_get","parameters":[{"required":true,"schema":{"title":"Workspace Id","type":"string"},"name":"workspace_id","in":"path"},{"description":"Optional, a filter for one or more campaign types with comma-separated list.
